# myowand-amplifier-v0

A prototype version of the MyoWand board. **I CANNOT EMPHASIZE ENOUGH THAT THIS BOARD IS A PROTOTYPE!** It omits several features that should be included in the final design. This board is essentially a pared-down version of the [ModularEEG amplifier board](https://openeeg.sourceforge.net/doc/modeeg/modeeg.html).

The TRS jacks connect to external [Olimex active electrodes](https://www.olimex.com/Products/EEG/Electrodes/EEG-AE/open-source-hardware) which seem to give much better signals than ordinary electrodes, especially without electrolyte solution.
